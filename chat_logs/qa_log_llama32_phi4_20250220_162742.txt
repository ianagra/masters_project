PHI 4 - Analysis - SYSTEM PROMPT:
==================================================
You are a computer networks specialist analyzing network performance data collected from an ISP network.

The data was processed as follows:

1. Change points were detected in download throughput time series for each client-server pair.
2. Intervals between changes were analyzed using survival analysis.
3. Intervals were clustered into 2 groups based on:
- Interval duration, in days;
- Associated metrics (throughput, RTT);
- Client and server IDs; and
- Event occurrence (1) or censored data (0).
4. Logistic regression was used to determine feature importance for cluster membership.

Keep responses direct and actionable. Focus on identifying specific elements needing intervention.
Always base your analysis on the data provided.

When analyzing temporal evolution:
- Look for trends and patterns in the data
- Identify periods of degraded performance
- Note any improvements or deteriorations over time

When analyzing clients or servers:
- Always consider the number of events, the time between changes and the odds ratios for cluster membership
- Highlight the key differences between clients or servers

When comparing clusters:
- Explain the characteristics of each cluster
- Highlight the key differences between clusters
- Indicate which represents better performance

Provide clear, actionable insights and specific recommendations based on the data.
Respond in clear language suitable for network operators.

Which cluster is the best and why?

Answer in clear language, suitable for network operators.
If you have already analyzed the clusters, keep in mind which cluster represents better performance.
Always compare the metrics with the time between changes, the interval length, and the Odds Ratio related to Cluster 1.

Include:
1. A detailed analysis of the performance patterns
2. Identification of any issues or anomalies
3. Specific recommendations for performance improvement

### Analysis of Performance Patterns

**Cluster 0:**
- **Throughput:** Lower mean download throughput (294.55 Mbps) and upload throughput (243.21 Mbps).
- **RTT:** Higher round-trip time (RTT) with a mean of 88.99 ms for downloads and 91.92 ms for uploads.
- **Time Intervals:** Shorter intervals between changes, with a mean of approximately 10.86 days and a median of about 4.86 days.

**Cluster 1:**
- **Throughput:** Higher mean download throughput (666.33 Mbps) and upload throughput (677.61 Mbps).
- **RTT:** Lower RTT with a mean of 21.38 ms for downloads and 23.27 ms for uploads.
- **Time Intervals:** Longer intervals between changes, with a mean of approximately 31.31 days and a median of about 28.72 days.

### Identification of Issues or Anomalies

1. **Cluster 0** shows significantly lower throughput and higher RTT compared to Cluster 1, indicating potential performance bottlenecks.
2. The shorter intervals between changes in Cluster 0 suggest more frequent disruptions or adjustments, which could be indicative of instability or recurring issues.

### Recommendations for Performance Improvement

1. **Focus on Cluster 0:**
   - Investigate the causes of lower throughput and higher RTT. This may involve checking network congestion, hardware limitations, or configuration errors.
   - Address the frequent changes in performance by identifying patterns or triggers that lead to these disruptions. Consider implementing more robust monitoring and automated response systems.

2. **Enhance Stability:**
   - For Cluster 0, aim to extend the time intervals between changes by improving network stability. This could involve upgrading infrastructure, optimizing routing protocols, or enhancing error correction mechanisms.

3. **Leverage Insights from Cluster 1:**
   - Analyze what is working well in Cluster 1 and apply similar strategies or configurations to Cluster 0 where applicable.
   - Ensure that the practices leading to longer intervals between changes and better performance metrics are documented and shared across teams for broader implementation.

By focusing on these areas, you can improve overall network performance and reduce the frequency of disruptions.
